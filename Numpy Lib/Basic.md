# Array 
An array is an arrangement of numbers, pictures or objects formatted into rows and columns according to their type.In coding and programming, an array is a collection of items, or data, stored in contiguous memory locations, also as database system.

# Numpy 
NumPy is a multidimensional array like 1D array , 2D array and 3D array.

# Why is Numpy faster 

1. Faster to read less bytes of memory.
2. No type checking when iterating through objects , it means Python, being a dynamically typed language, doesn't enforce       strict type checking during runtime. This flexibility, while powerful, can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when iterating through objects.
3. NumPy is faster than list also because of contiguous memory.

# Applications of Numpy 
1. Mathematics (MATLAB replacement)
2. Plotting (Matplotlib)
3. Backend (Pandas , Connect 4)
4. Machine Learning
   
# To start to use 
 
we have to write first 
import numpy as np

# 
eg- 
  ```
 import numpy as np 
  a = np.array([1,2,3])
  print(a)

```
o/p-
[1,2,3]
